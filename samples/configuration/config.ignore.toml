# 2021-06-01

# This file is used by the build system to direct and control how the files are
# processed. It is possible to split the contents of this configuration file
# into multiple TOML files. This allows you to reuse common parts without
# having to duplicate settings and introduce potential errors.

# NOTE: All paths should be relative to the repo root, i.e. the folder containing
# the .git folder.

# NOTE: This document is case sensitive.

# NOTE: For anything that is deemed optional, if you do not want to include it,
# remove the key entirely from the configuration file or comment the line out.
