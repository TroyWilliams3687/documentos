    From [Pandoc]
    (https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-auto_identifiers):

    ```
    The default algorithm used to derive the identifier from the
    heading text is:

    - Remove all formatting, links, etc.
    - Remove all footnotes.
    - Remove all non-alphanumeric characters, except underscores,
      hyphens, and periods.
    - Replace all spaces and newlines with hyphens.
    - Convert all alphabetic characters to lowercase.
    - Remove everything up to the first letter (identifiers may not
      begin with a number or punctuation mark).
    - If nothing is left after this, use the identifier section.

    Thus, for example,
    Heading                         Identifier
    Heading identifiers in HTML     heading-identifiers-in-html
    Maître d'hôtel                  maître-dhôtel
    *Dogs*?--in *my* house?         dogs--in-my-house
    [HTML], [S5], or [RTF]?         html-s5-or-rtf
    3. Applications                 applications
    33                              section

    Preamble {#sec:ch0_0_preamble-1}  sec:ch0_0_preamble-1
    ```

    These anchors can be used in links:
    ```
    See the section on
    [heading identifiers](#heading-identifiers-in-html-latex-and-context).
    ```

    # NOTE

    Pandoc Extension: gfm_auto_identifiers

    Changes the algorithm used by auto_identifiers to conform to
    GitHub’s method. Spaces are converted to dashes (-), uppercase
    characters to lowercase characters, and punctuation characters
    other than - and _ are removed.

    We'll stick with the basics (for now).

    (relative links) and:

    1. Remove them, leaving a link to a section anchor
    2. Rename the .md file to .html leaving the links intact

    1. Does the line contain a markdown link?
    2. Is the URL portion absolute (http://www.iring.ca)?
    3. Is the URL relative (../file.md#section_title)?

    - If it is not a markdown link the line is returned unaltered.
    - If the URL is absolute, the line is returned unaltered.

    Option 1:

    - If the URL is relative, the markdown file is removed
    - if the URL is relative and doesn't contain a section id an
      exception is raised.
        - The user obviously wants to link to the beginning of the
          document. This should be allowed for the cases where the
          individual markdown will be compiled to standalone HTML.
          However, since this is a compressed/merged format this
          doesn't make sense. We could read the document and figure it
          out, but we don't want to. It should be explicit if we are
          compressing/merging the document into one compressed format.

    Option 2:

    remove_relative_md_link:bool
