# It is possible to have nested documents. You are free to add the links to the
# Markdown files directly or have reference nested LST files like:

# mining/mining.lst
# models/models.lst
# geometry/geometry.lst

# Using nested LST files will simplify things quite a lot and allow you to choose what
# sections of your documentation to build.
